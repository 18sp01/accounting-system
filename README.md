## Problem Statement
As university students work part time or get allowance, we know first hand the problems of organizing money. We will be building a user-friendly lightweight accounting system catered towards students like us.

## Problem Setting
Young people may find it difficult to transition into financial indepedence, yet building a habit to monitor their own spending may prove to be a daunting task, especially when many existing finance managers are complicated and inconvenient to use on a day-to-day basis. This has caused their inability to help motivate students into properly organizing their money. Our simple yet efficient accounting system will help university students track their money in an uncomplicated manner. 

## Basic Features
### 1. Add records of income and expenses
Students are able to easily add how much money they gained and how much money they used. Income and expenses will be updated in the database.
### 2. See information about income and expense
Users are able to view different information about their income and expenses such as amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc.), account (e.g. cash, bank card, credit card, etc.).
### 3. Fully editable records
Users are able to view, edit or delete their financial records at anytime.
### 4. View categorized records
Users are able to sort and filter their records by date, type, and account when necessesary.
### 5. Detailed statistical reports
Users have access to a wide range of statistical reports (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.) that reflects their financial status.
### 6. Budget setting
The system also allows users to set a budget. And when expenses reach the budget, there is an alarm system in place to remind the user.

## Additional Features
### 1. Finacial Status and Budgeting Visuslizer
One of the additional features is a new function which helps users visualize their spendings and savings. Through the use of graphs, we remind users of their progress towards their financial goals.
### 2. Simple Interface and User Flow
Since it could be difficult for users to build a habit to track their spending, we hope to make doing so as easy as possible. We have created a simple user interface where users can give commands by entering a single letter. 
### 3. As a result, another one of our features is 'keywords'. The user can set keywords for some of their usual spendings, therefore instead of typing the whole name of the item, just typing the keyword would do. The user could also attach expenses to usual spendings, which means they would not have to type in the expense everytime.

for how ever long they choose (e.g. 1 day for daily, 7 days for weekly, etc.)
