## Problem Statement
As university students work part time or get allowance, we know first hand the problems of organizing money. We will be building a user-friendly lightweight accounting system catered towards students like us.

## Problem Setting
Young people may find it difficult to transition into financial indepedence, yet building a habit to monitor their own spending may prove to be a daunting task, especially when many existing finance managers are complicated and inconvenient to use on a day-to-day basis. This has caused their inability to help motivate students into properly organizing their money.

## Features
### Add records of income and expenses
Students should be able to easily add how much money they gained and how much money they used. Income and expenses will be updated real time in the database.
### See information about income and expense
Users will be able to view different information about their income and expenses such as amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc.), account (e.g. cash, bank card, credit card, etc.).
### Fully editable and categorizable records
Users would be able to view, edit or delete their financial records at anytime and they would also be able to sort and filter their records by date, type, and account when necessesary.
### Detailed financial reports
Users would have access to a wide range of statistical reports (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.) that reflects their financial status if they so choose.
### Budget setting
The system also allows users to set a budget daily or weekly budget. And when expenses reach the budget, there is an alarm system in place to remind the user.
### Finacial Status and Budgeting Visuslizer
One of the main features is a new function which helps users visualize their spendings and savings. Through the use of graphs and other visuals we remind users of their progress towards their financial goals, and suggest spending habits that would help them more easily achieve them.
### Simple Interface and User Flow
Since it could be difficult for users to build a habit to track their spending, we hope to make doing so as easy as possible. As a result, another one of our features is 'keywords'. The user can set keywords for some of their usual spendings, therefore instead of typing the whole name of the item, just typing the keyword would do. The user could also attach expenses to usual spendings, which means they would not have to type in the expense everytime.
