## Problem Statement
As university students work part time or get allowance, we know first hand the problems of organizing money. We will be building a user-friendly lightweight accounting system catered towards students like us.

## Problem Setting
Young people may find it difficult to transition into financial indepedence, yet building a habit to monitor their own spending may prove to be a daunting task, especially when many existing finance managers are complicated and inconvenient to use on a day-to-day basis. This has caused their inability to help motivate students into properly organizing their money. Our simple yet efficient accounting system will help university students track their money in an uncomplicated manner. 

## Basic Features
### 1. Add records of income and expenses
Students are able to easily add how much money they gained and how much money they used. Income and expenses will be updated in the database.
### 2. See information about income and expense
Users are able to view different information about their income and expenses such as amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc.), account (e.g. cash, bank card, credit card, etc.).
### 3. Fully editable records
Users are able to view, edit or delete their financial records at anytime.
### 4. View categorized records
Users are able to sort and filter their records by date, type, and account when necessesary.
### 5. Detailed statistical reports
Users have access to a wide range of statistical reports (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.) that reflects their financial status.
### 6. Budget setting
The system also allows users to set a budget. And when expenses reach the budget, there is an alarm system in place to remind the user.

## Additional Features
### 1. Statistical graphs
One of the additional features is a new function which helps users visualize their spendings and savings. Through the use of graphs, we remind users of their progress towards their financial goals. Common statistics such as total income, total expenses, and total income + expenses are available and users can enter what type and what account to compare theses statistics to.
### 2. Simple user interface
Since it could be difficult for users to build a habit to track their spending, we hope to make doing so as easy as possible. We have created a simple user interface where users can give commands by entering a single letter. 
### 3. Budget planner
Expanding on a simple budget setting function, we created a planner where the user can choose how long they want to budget (e.g. 1 day for daily, 7 days for weekly, etc.). The accouting system tracks in real time how much money the user can spend until the budget time is over.
